# SowwisePlatoPizza
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of Plato’s Pizza sales performance, with the aim of generating a strategic and data-driven report that will help reposition the business for improved profitability and operational efficiency. The analysis seeks to uncover meaningful insights that can guide management in making informed decisions about sales optimization, resource allocation, and customer engagement.

The study examines key performance indicators (KPIs) across the business cycle, including identifying:

The busiest and least busy days and times of operation, to support better staff scheduling, inventory planning, and workflow management.

The best-selling and worst-selling pizza products, which will help the company understand customer preferences, streamline the menu, and improve product offerings.

Average Order Value (AOV), to measure customer spending patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of upselling or promotional strategies.

Total revenue generated within the period under review, providing insight into the company’s financial performance.

Sales seasonality in the year 2015, enabling the business to understand monthly and seasonal fluctuations that influence demand, and to plan targeted marketing activities accordingly.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to empower Plato’s Pizza with actionable insights—allowing the brand to strategically position itself for increased sales, enhanced customer satisfaction, and more efficient operations.
