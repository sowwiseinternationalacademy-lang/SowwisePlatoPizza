In order to support Plato's brand repositioning in the pizza industry, it is imperative that the company use strategic KPIs to assess business performance on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. This is because the pizza industry is a global one that requires sustainability, growth, and expansion.  Based on consumer preferences and seasonality, Plato can therefore convert the best items into cash cows.
