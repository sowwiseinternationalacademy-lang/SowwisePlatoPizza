Total revenue generated within the period under review, providing insight into the company’s financial performance.

Sales seasonality in the year 2015, enabling the business to understand monthly and seasonal fluctuations that influence demand, and to plan targeted marketing activities accordingly.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to empower Plato’s Pizza with actionable insights—allowing the brand to strategically position itself for increased sales, enhanced customer satisfaction, and more efficient operations.
